# Abstract

A very short test document to verify Quarto/Pandoc citation processing using a `bibliography.bib` file located in the same folder.

# Introduction

This is a minimal test of citations. An inline citation example: according to recent work [@Zhao2020], the method performs well. Multiple citations can be included together [@Zhao2020; @Alqahtani2020].

# Notes


# References

(Quarto will populate this from `bibliography.bib` when rendered.)
