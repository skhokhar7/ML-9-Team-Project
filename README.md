# ML-9 Team Project

After reviewing several datasets, we have decided to investigate the Stroke Prediction one. We are investigating whether a difference can be found by ML between male and female subjects.

## Possible Questions:

Are there different risk factors per age group, which would indicate different prevention strategies?

BMI, Age, Rural/Urban, see if there's different risk factors/prevention for different groups


## Approaches:
Regression to find composition and correlation of different variables

Based on significance of variables, create a model to predict stroke or not

**We have determined that we need to develop an experiment 

## Possible Problem:
The occurance of stroke overwhelms the lack of stroke by an order of magnitude.
