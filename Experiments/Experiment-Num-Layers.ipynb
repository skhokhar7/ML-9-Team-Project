    "### Experiment: Determine Optimal Number of Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to conduct an experiment to find the optimal number of layers for our neural network model given the dataset we have decided upon, the Stroke Prediction dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset). This will involve training multiple models with varying numbers of layers and evaluating their performance on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently run these experiments, we will leverage Dask to parallelize the training process across multiple CPU cores. This will significantly speed up our experimentation phase. Additionally, we can utilize Google Colab to access GPU resources for training our models, further enhancing our ability to test different architectures quickly.    \n"
