   abstract = {Background: Because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition, the identification of specific clinical phenotypes is key to developing more effective therapies. To explore if the persistence of systemic inflammation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD we assessed patients recruited to the well-characterized ECLIPSE cohort (NCT00292552). Methods and Findings: Six inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood (white blood cells (WBC) count and CRP, IL-6, IL-8, fibrinogen and TNF-α levels) were quantified in 1,755 COPD patients, 297 smokers with normal spirometry and 202 non-smoker controls that were followed-up for three years. We found that, at baseline, 30% of COPD patients did not show evidence of systemic inflammation whereas 16% had persistent systemic inflammation. Even though pulmonary abnormalities were similar in these two groups, persistently inflamed patients during follow-up had significantly increased all-cause mortality (13% vs. 2%, p<0.001) and exacerbation frequency (1.5 (1.5) vs. 0.9 (1.1) per year, p<0.001) compared to non-inflamed ones. As a descriptive study our results show associations but do not prove causality. Besides this, the inflammatory response is complex and we studied only a limited panel of biomarkers, albeit they are those investigated by the majority of previous studies and are often and easily measured in clinical practice. Conclusions: Overall, these results identify a novel systemic inflammatory COPD phenotype that may be the target of specific research and treatment. © 2012 Agustí et al.},

This meta-analysis aimed to explore the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing smoking history. A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The languages of literature included English and Chinese. The point prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing COPD and those with ongoing smoking was evaluated with this meta-analysis. Overall 11 case series, published either in Chinese or English language with a total of 2002 cases, were included in this study. The pooled OR of COPD and the development of severe COVID-19 was 4.38 (fixed-effects model; 95% CI: 2.34-8.20), while the OR of ongoing smoking was 1.98 (fixed-effects model; 95% CI: 1.29-3.05). There was no publication bias as examined by the funnel plot and Egger's test (P = not significant). The heterogeneity of included studies was moderate for both COPD and ongoing smoking history on the severity of COVID-19. COPD and ongoing smoking history attribute to the worse progression and outcome of COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an evolving infectious disease that dramatically spread all over the world in the early part of 2020. No studies have yet summarized the potential severity and mortality risks caused by COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we update information in smokers. Methods We systematically searched electronic databases from inception to March 24, 2020. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model to calculate pooled prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results In total, 123 abstracts were screened and 61 full-text manuscripts were reviewed. A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, which included a total of 2473 confirmed COVID-19 patients. All studies were included in the meta-analysis. The crude case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 7.4%. The pooled prevalence rates of COPD patients and smokers in COVID-19 cases were 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) and 9% (95% CI, 4%-14%) respectively. COPD patients were at a higher risk of more severe disease (risk of severity = 63%, (22/35) compared to patients without COPD 33.4% (409/1224) [calculated RR, 1.88 (95% CI, 1.4- 2.4)]. This was associated with higher mortality (60%). Our results showed that 22% (31/139) of current smokers and 46% (13/28) of ex-smokers had severe complications. The calculated RR showed that current smokers were 1.45 times more likely [95% CI: 1.03-2.04] to have severe complications compared to former and never smokers. Current smokers also had a higher mortality rate of 38.5%. Conclusion Although COPD prevalence in COVID-19 cases was low in current reports, COVID-19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in COPD. Compared to former and never smokers, current smokers were at greater risk of severe complications and higher mortality rate. Effective preventive measures are required to reduce COVID-19 risk in COPD patients and current smokers.},

Objective: To explore the influence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comorbidity on disease expression and outcomes, and the potential underlying mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of 961 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic and clinical information were extracted from the medical records. Lung tissue sections from patients suffering from lung cancer were used for immunohistochemistry study of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) expression. BEAS-2B cell line was stimulated with various cytokines. Results: In this cohort, 21 subjects (2.2%) had COPD and 22 (2.3%) had asthma. After adjusting for confounding factors, COPD patients had higher risk of developing severe illness (OR: 23.433; 95% CI 1.525-360.135; P <.01) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR: 19.762; 95% CI 1.461-267.369; P =.025) than asthmatics. COPD patients, particularly those with severe COVID-19, had lower counts of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells and B cells and higher levels of TNF-α, IL-2 receptor, IL-10, IL-8, and IL-6 than asthmatics. COPD patients had increased, whereas asthmatics had decreased ACE2 protein expression in lower airways, compared with that in control subjects without asthma and COPD. IL-4 and IL-13 downregulated, but TNF-α, IL-12, and IL-17A upregulated ACE2 expression in BEAS-2B cells. Conclusion: Patients with asthma and COPD likely have different risk of severe COVID-19, which may be associated with different ACE2 expression.},

A free-form image registration technique is used to match a baseline 3D CT lung scan onto a following scan. Areas with lower intensity in the following scan compared with intensities in the deformed baseline image indicate local loss of lung tissue that is associated with progression of emphysema. To account for differences in lung intensity owing to differences in the inspiration level in the two scans rather than disease progression, we propose to adjust the density of lung tissue with respect to local expansion or compression such that the total weight of the lungs is preserved during deformation. Our method provides a good estimation of regional destruction of lung tissue for subjects with a significant difference in inspiration level between CT scans and may result in a more sensitive measure of disease progression than standard quantitative CT measures.},

   abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease involving more than airflow obstruction. Airflow obstruction has profound effects on cardiac function and gas exchange with systemic consequences. In addition, as COPD results from inflammation and/or alterations in repair mechanisms, the "spill-over" of inflammatory mediators into the circulation may result in important systemic manifestations of the disease, such as skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia. Systemic inflammation may also initiate or worsen comorbid diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, osteoporosis, normocytic anaemia, lung cancer, depression and diabetes. Comorbid diseases potentiate the morbidity of COPD, leading to increased hospitalisations, mortality and healthcare costs. Comorbidities complicate the management of COPD and need to be evaluated carefully. Current therapies for comorbid diseases, such as statins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-agonists, may provide unexpected benefits for COPD patients. Treatment of COPD inflammation may concomitantly treat systemic inflammation and associated comorbidities. However, new broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments, such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, have significant side-effects so it may be necessary to develop inhaled drugs in the future. Another approach is the reversal of corticosteroid resistance, for example with effective antioxidants. More research is needed on COPD comorbidities and their treatment.

   abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic disease of unknown aetiology characterized by the formation of immune granulomas in involved organs. It is a worldwide disease that mainly affects 25-40 years old people with a lifetime incidence rate of 0.85-2.4%. Multiple clinical phenotypes are observed according to presentation, involved organs, disease duration and severity. Sarcoidosis primarily affects the lungs and the lymphatic system. The prevailing pathogenic hypothesis is that various antigens could promote sarcoidosis in genetically susceptible hosts, both these factors modulating the incidence and the clinical phenotype of sarcoidosis. So far, environmental agents have been suspected, including possible mycobacteria and propionibacteria. Interferon-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 play a critical role in driving the Th1 commitment in the course of granulomatous process. Evolution of sarcoidosis is often marked by spontaneous resolution within 12-36 months, but can be severe because of chronic cases with pulmonary fibrosis or involving other organs, including heart, central nervous system and eyes. Mortality, ranging between 0.5 and 5%, is most often related to pulmonary fibrosis. Corticosteroids can reverse the granulomatous process, but are only suspensive, and their long-term benefit remains under question. Corticosteroids are recommended when sarcoidosis shows unfavourable clinical tolerance and evolution. Alternative and corticosteroid-sparing therapies are of increased interest in difficult cases, while targeted new drugs such as anti-TNF-α are still under investigation.

   abstract = {The characteristics that predict progression to overt chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in smokers without spirometric airflow obstruction are not clearly defined. We conducted a post hoc analysis of 849 current and former smokers (≥20 pack-years) with preserved spirometry from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) cohort who had baseline computed tomography (CT) scans of lungs and serial spirometry. We examined whether CT-derived lung volumes representing air trapping could predict adverse respiratory outcomes and more rapid decline in spirometry to overt COPD using mixed-effect linear modelling. Among these subjects with normal forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio, CT-measured residual volume (RVCT) to total lung capacity (TLCCT) ratio varied widely, from 21% to 59%. Over 2.5±0.7 years of follow-up, subjects with higher RVCT/TLCCT had a greater differential rate of decline in FEV1/FVC; those in the upper RVCT/TLCCT tertile had a 0.66% (95% CI 0.06%-1.27%) faster rate of decline per year compared with those in the lower tertile (p=0.015) regardless of demographics, baseline spirometry, respiratory symptoms score, smoking status (former versus current) or smoking burden (pack-years). Accordingly, subjects with higher RVCT/TLCCT were more likely to develop spirometric COPD (OR 5.7 (95% CI 2.4-13.2) in upper versus lower RVCT/TLCCT tertile; p<0.001). Other CT indices of air trapping showed similar patterns of association with lung function decline; however, when all CT indices of air trapping, emphysema, and airway disease were included in the same model, only RVCT/TLCCT retained its significance. Increased air trapping based on radiographic lung volumes predicts accelerated spirometry decline and progression to COPD in smokers without obstruction.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), abnormal gas-transfer and pulmonary vascular density have been reported, but such findings have not been related to each other or to symptoms and exercise limitation. The pathophysiologic drivers of PACS in patients previously infected with COVID-19 who were admitted to in-patient treatment in hospital (or ever-hospitalized patients) and never-hospitalized patients are not well understood. PURPOSE: To determine the relationship of persistent symptoms and exercise limitation with xenon 129 (129Xe) MRI and CT pulmonary vascular measurements in individuals with PACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, patients with PACS aged 18-80 years with a positive polymerase chain reaction COVID-19 test were recruited from a quaternary-care COVID-19 clinic between April and October 2021. Participants with PACS underwent spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco), 129Xe MRI, and chest CT. Healthy controls had no prior history of COVID-19 and underwent spirometry, DLco, and 129Xe MRI. The 129Xe MRI red blood cell (RBC) to alveolar-barrier signal ratio, RBC area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), CT volume of pulmonary vessels with cross-sectional area 5 mm2 or smaller (BV5), and total blood volume were quantified. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and modified Borg Dyspnea Scale measured quality of life, exercise limitation, and dyspnea. Differences between groups were compared with use of Welch t-tests or Welch analysis of variance. Relationships were evaluated with use of Pearson (r) and Spearman (ρ) correlations. RESULTS: Forty participants were evaluated, including six controls (mean age ± SD, 35 years ± 15, three women) and 34 participants with PACS (mean age, 53 years ± 13, 18 women), of whom 22 were never hospitalized. The 129Xe MRI RBC:barrier ratio was lower in ever-hospitalized participants (P = .04) compared to controls. BV5 correlated with RBC AUC (ρ = .44, P = .03). The 129Xe MRI RBC:barrier ratio was related to DLco (r = .57, P = .002) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ρ = .35, P = .03); RBC AUC was related to dyspnea (ρ = -.35, P = .04) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire score (ρ = .45, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Xenon 129 (129Xe) MRI measurements were lower in participants previously infected with COVID-19 who were admitted to in-patient treatment in hospital with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, 34 weeks ± 25 after infection compared to controls. The 129Xe MRI measures were associated with CT pulmonary vascular density, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, exercise capacity, and dyspnea.

Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models.

However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth.

   abstract = {Reproducibility verification is essential to the practice of the scientific method. Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature. Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification. This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads.

   abstract = {What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i)give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii)indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii)provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.},

   abstract = {This paper tries to give a gentle introduction to deep learning in medical image processing, proceeding from theoretical foundations to applications. We first discuss general reasons for the popularity of deep learning, including several major breakthroughs in computer science. Next, we start reviewing the fundamental basics of the perceptron and neural networks, along with some fundamental theory that is often omitted. Doing so allows us to understand the reasons for the rise of deep learning in many application domains. Obviously medical image processing is one of these areas which has been largely affected by this rapid progress, in particular in image detection and recognition, image segmentation, image registration, and computer-aided diagnosis. There are also recent trends in physical simulation, modeling, and reconstruction that have led to astonishing results. Yet, some of these approaches neglect prior knowledge and hence bear the risk of producing implausible results. These apparent weaknesses highlight current limitations of deep learning. However, we also briefly discuss promising approaches that might be able to resolve these problems in the future.},

   abstract = {on behalf of the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease Rationale: Predicting increased risk of future healthcare utilization in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is an important goal for improving patient management. Objective: Our objective was to determine the importance of computed tomography (CT) lung imaging measurements relative to other demographic and clinical measurements for predicting future health services use with machine learning in COPD. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, lung function measurements and chest CT images were acquired from Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease study participants from 2010 to 2017 (https://clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00920348). Up to two follow-up visits (1.5-and 3-year follow-up) were performed and participants were asked for details related to healthcare utilization. Healthcare utilization was defined as any COPD hospitalization or emergency room visit due to respiratory problems in the 12 months prior to the follow-up visits. CT analysis was performed (VIDA Diagnostics Inc.); a total of 108 CT quantitative emphysema, airway and vascular measurements were investigated. A hybrid feature selection method with support vector machine classifier was used to predict healthcare utilization. Performance was determined using accuracy, F1-measure and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Matthews's correlation coefficient (MC). Results: Of the 527 COPD participants evaluated, 179 (35%) used healthcare services at follow-up. There were no significant differences between the participants with or without healthcare utilization at follow-up for age (p = 0.50), sex (p = 0.44), BMI (p = 0.05) or pack-years (p = 0.76). The accuracy for predicting subsequent healthcare utilization was 80% § 3% (F1-measure = 74%, AUC = 0.80, MC = 0.6) when all measurements were considered, 76% § 6% (F1-measure = 72%, AUC = 0.77, MC = 0.55) for CT measurements alone and 65% § 5% (F1-measure = 60%, AUC = 0.67, MC = 0.34) for demographic and lung function measurements alone. Conclusion: The combination of CT lung imaging and conventional measurements leads to greater prediction accuracy of subsequent health services use than conventional measurements alone, and may provide needed prognostic information for patients suffering from COPD.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Texture-based radiomics analysis of lung computed tomography (CT) images has been shown to predict chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) status using machine learning models. However, various approaches are used and it is unclear which provides the best performance. Objectives: To compare the most commonly used feature selection and classification methods and determine the optimal models for classifying COPD status in a mild, population-based COPD cohort. Materials and Methods: CT images from the multi-center Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study were pre-processed by resampling the image to a 1mm isotropic voxel volume, segmenting the lung and removing the airways (VIDA Diagnostics Inc.), and applying a threshold of-1000HU-to-0HU. A total of 95 texture features were then extracted from each CT image. Combinations of 17 feature selection methods and 9 classifiers were tested and evaluated. In addition, the role of data cleaning (outlier removal and highly correlated feature removal) was evaluated. The area under the curve (AUC) from the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate model performance. Results: A total of 1204 participants were evaluated (n = 602 no COPD, n = 602 COPD). There were no significant differences between the groups for female sex (no COPD = 46.3%; COPD = 38.5%; p = 0.77), or body mass index (no COPD = 27.7 kg/m 2 ; COPD = 27.4 kg/m 2 ; p = 0.21). The highest AUC value for predicting COPD status (AUC = 0.78 [0.73, 0.84]) was obtained following data cleaning and feature selection using Elastic Net with the Linear-SVM classifier. Conclusion: In a population-based cohort, the optimal combination for radiomics-based prediction of COPD status was Elastic Net as the feature selection method and Linear-SVM as the classifier.},

Methods: We analyzed statewide ED surveillance system data to quantify the frequency of COPDrelated ED visits, hospital admissions, and comorbidities. Results: In 2008 to 2009 in North Carolina, 97,511 COPD-related ED visits were made by adults ≥ 45 years of age, at an annual rate of 13.8 ED visits/1,000 person-years. Among patients with COPD (n = 33,799), 7% and 28% had a COPD-related return ED visit within a 30-and 365-day period of their index visit, respectively. Compared with patients on private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and noninsured patients were more likely to have a COPD-related return visit within 30 and 365 days and have three or more COPD-related visits within 365 days. There were no differences in return visits by sex. Fifty-one percent of patients with COPD were admitted to the hospital from the index ED visit. Subsequent hospital admission risk in the cohort increased with age, peaking at 65 to 69 years (risk ratio [RR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.26-1.57); there was no difference by sex. Patients with congestive heart failure (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22-1.37), substance-related disorders (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13-1.60), or respiratory failure/supplemental oxygen (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.31) were more likely to have a subsequent hospital admission compared with patients without these comorbidities. Conclusions: The population-based burden of COPD-related care in the ED is signifi cant. Further research is needed to understand variations in COPD-related ED visits and hospital admissions.},

This article describes the protocol objectives, design and the approaches taken in the Canadian Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study, an epidemiological and integrated research. The CanCOLD study aims at better understanding heterogeneity of COPD presentation and disease progression. We hypothesize that individuals with unfavourable COPD "phenotypes" and subjects at-risk (ever smokers) with unhealthy lifestyle habits, environmental/work exposure, or co-morbidities will have increased risk of lung function decline independent of their cumulative exposure to cigarette smoke. The study is a prospective multi-center cohort study (9 sites in 6 provinces) built on the Canadian COPD prevalence study "COLD." The study plan is to include 1800 subjects at least 40 years old who were sampled from the general population and who were found to fall within 4 groups: 1) COPD moderate-severe (GOLD 2-4); 2) COPD mild (GOLD 1); 3) subjects at-risk (ever smoker); and, 4) subjects never-smoker free of airflow obstruction. Data collection is based on using strictly standardized methods involving questionnaires, pulmonary function and cardiorespiratory exercise tests, CT scans, and blood sampling. CanCOLD is a unique study that will address challenging and important research questions on COPD disease evolution and disease management and will help to define the natural history of COPD disease evolution in individuals at-risk for COPD and in those with COPD who have mild disease. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

This design pattern is partition-independent, because it is expressed in terms of an interactive application running in a single address space. Applying the Model/View/Controller design pattern to web-applications is therefore complicated by the fact that current technologies encourage developers to partition the application as early as in the design phase. Subsequent changes to that partitioning require considerable changes to the application's implementation-despite the fact that the application logic has not changed. This paper introduces the concept of Flexible Web-Application Partitioning, a programming model and implementation infrastructure, that allows developers to apply the Model/View/Controller design pattern in a partition-independent manner Applications are developed and tested in a single address-space; they can then be deployed to various client/server architectures without changing the application's source code.

Then, a multi-label learning model is exploited for the classification creation differential diagnoses for emphysema and then used to correlate with the emphysema diagnosed by radiologists. The five lung tissue patterns which are involved in most lung disease differential diagnoses were classified as: ground glass, fibrosis, micronodules (random, perilymphatic and centrilobular lung nodules), normal appearing lung, and emphysematous lung tissue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end deep learning pipeline for the creation of differential diagnoses for lung disease and the quantification of emphysema. A comparative analysis shows the performance of the proposed pipeline on two publicly available datasets.},

   abstract = {I schemic stroke is a leading cause of the global disease burden, making its prevention a major public heath challenge. Risk stratification on the basis of traditional risk factors enables identifying patients at particularly high stroke risk. 1 Beyond traditional risk factors, novel circulating biomarkers may improve risk stratification and, ultimately, clinical management of ambulatory patients. 2 Previous studies have mostly investigated single biomarkers and, more recently, some studies have evaluated several biomarkers from a given biological pathway. In the Prospective Epidemiological Study on Myocardial Infarction (PRIME), we have shown an incremental value of chemokines and adipocytokines in predicting ischemic stroke. 3,4 Biomarkers of hemostasis, inflammation, and endothelial activation represent further candidates for risk prediction, but evidence for their prospective association and prognostic relevance with regard to ischemic stroke is yet to be established. Moreover, simultaneous assessment of multiple biomarkers from distinct biological pathways, the so-called multimarker approach, has been hypothesized to enhance risk prediction in a clinically relevant manner. 5 Supporting evidence for this hypothesis has primarily been provided by studies investigating combined cardiovascular outcomes. 5-7 With regard to cerebrovascular disease, only 2 previous studies have used the approach, 1 for ischemic stroke among postmenopausal women and 1 for total stroke and transient ischemic attack in adult men and women. 8,9 Therefore, among healthy European middle-aged men from the PRIME study, our first objective was to newly quantify associations of 9 biomarkers of hemostasis (fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1], von Willebrand factor antigen [vWF]), inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and endothelial activation (E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, CD-40 ligand [CD40L]) with the risk of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, associations between these biomarkers and ischemic stroke were examined, including 5 biomarkers that were previously identified to be associated with ischemic stroke in the PRIME The online-only Data Supplement is available with this article at http://atvb.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/ Objective-To simultaneously evaluate 14 biomarkers from distinct biological pathways for risk prediction of ischemic stroke, including biomarkers of hemostasis, inflammation, and endothelial activation as well as chemokines and adipocytokines. Methods and Results-The Prospective Epidemiological Study on Myocardial Infarction (PRIME) is a cohort of 9771 healthy men 50 to 59 years of age who were followed up over 10 years. In a nested case-control study, 95 ischemic stroke cases were matched with 190 controls. After multivariable adjustment for traditional risk factors, fibrinogen (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.28), E-selectin (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.93), interferon-γ-inducible-protein-10 (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.06-2.78), resistin (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.30-6.27), and total adiponectin (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.04-3.19) were significantly associated with ischemic stroke. Adding E-selectin and resistin to a traditional risk factor model significantly increased the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve from 0.679 (95% CI, 0.612-0.745) to 0.785 and 0.788, respectively, and yielded a categorical net reclassification improvement of 29.9% (P=0.001) and 28.4% (P=0.002), respectively. Their simultaneous inclusion in the traditional risk factor model increased the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve to 0.824 (95% CI, 0.770-0.877) and resulted in an net reclassification improvement of 41.4% (P<0.001). Results were confirmed when using continuous net reclassification improvement. Conclusion-Among multiple biomarkers from distinct biological pathways, E-selectin and resistin provided incremental and additive value to traditional risk factors in predicting ischemic stroke.

   abstract = {Predicting functional outcomes after an Ischemic Stroke (IS) is highly valuable for patients and desirable for physicians. This facilitates physicians to set reasonable goals for patients and cooperate with patients and relatives effectively, and furthermore to reach common after-stroke care decisions for recovery and make exercise plans to facilitate rehabilitation. The objective of this research is to apply three current Deep Learning (DL) approaches for 6-month IS outcome predictions, using the openly accessible International Stroke Trial (IST) dataset. Furthermore, another objective of this research is to compare these DL approaches with machine learning (ML) for performing in clinical prediction. After comparing various ML methods (Deep Forest, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, etc.) with current DL frameworks (CNN, LSTM, Resnet), the results show that DL doesn’t outperform ML significantly. DL methods and reporting used for analyzing structured medical data should be developed and improved.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Stroke severity measured by the baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a strong predictor of stroke outcome. Early change of baseline severity may be a better predictor of outcome. Here, we hypothesized that the change in NIHSS in the first 24 h after stroke improved stroke outcome prediction. Materials and methods: Patients from the Leuven Stroke Genetics Study were included when the baseline NIHSS (B-NIHSS) was determined on admission in the hospital and NIHSS after 24 h could be obtained from patient files. The delta NIHSS, relative reduction NIHSS, and major neurological improvement (NIHSS of 0-1 or ≥8-point improvement at 24 h) were calculated. Good functional outcome (GFO) at 90 days was defined as a modified Rankin Scale of 0-2. Independent predictors of outcome were identified by multivariate logistic regression. We performed a secondary analysis after excluding patients presenting with a minor stroke (NIHSS 0-5) since the assessment of change in NIHSS might be more reliable in patients presenting with a moderate to severe deficit. Results: We analyzed the outcome in 369 patients. B-NIHSS was associated with GFO (odds ratio: 0.82; 95% CI 0.77-0.86). In a multivariate model with B-NIHSS and age as predictors, the accuracy [area under the curve (AUC): 0.82] improved by including the delta NIHSS (AUC: 0.86; p < 0.01). In 131 patients with moderate to severe stroke, the predictive multivariate model was more accurate when including the RR NIHSS (AUC: 0.83) to the model which included B-NIHSS, age and ischemic heart disease (AUC: 0.77; p = 0.03). Conclusion: B-NIHSS is a predictor of stroke outcome. In this cohort, the prediction of GFO was improved by adding change in stroke severity after 24 h to the model.},

   abstract = {Importance: Predicting infarct size and location is important for decision-making and prognosis in patients with acute stroke. Objectives: To determine whether a deep learning model can predict final infarct lesions using magnetic resonance images (MRIs) acquired at initial presentation (baseline) and to compare the model with current clinical prediction methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multicenter prognostic study, a specific type of neural network for image segmentation (U-net) was trained, validated, and tested using patients from the Imaging Collaterals in Acute Stroke (iCAS) study from April 14, 2014, to April 15, 2018, and the Diffusion Weighted Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study-2 (DEFUSE-2) study from July 14, 2008, to September 17, 2011 (reported in October 2012). Patients underwent baseline perfusion-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging and MRI at 3 to 7 days after baseline. Patients were grouped into unknown, minimal, partial, and major reperfusion status based on 24-hour imaging results. Baseline images acquired at presentation were inputs, and the final true infarct lesion at 3 to 7 days was considered the ground truth for the model. The model calculated the probability of infarction for every voxel, which can be thresholded to produce a prediction. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to March 7, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Area under the curve, Dice score coefficient (DSC) (a metric from 0-1 indicating the extent of overlap between the prediction and the ground truth; a DSC of ≥0.5 represents significant overlap), and volume error. Current clinical methods were compared with model performance in subgroups of patients with minimal or major reperfusion. Results: Among the 182 patients included in the model (97 women [53.3%]; mean [SD] age, 65 [16] years), the deep learning model achieved a median area under the curve of 0.92 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.87-0.96), DSC of 0.53 (IQR, 0.31-0.68), and volume error of 9 (IQR, -14 to 29) mL. In subgroups with minimal (DSC, 0.58 [IQR, 0.31-0.67] vs 0.55 [IQR, 0.40-0.65]; P =.37) or major (DSC, 0.48 [IQR, 0.29-0.65] vs 0.45 [IQR, 0.15-0.54]; P =.002) reperfusion for which comparison with existing clinical methods was possible, the deep learning model had comparable or better performance. Conclusions and Relevance: The deep learning model appears to have successfully predicted infarct lesions from baseline imaging without reperfusion information and achieved comparable performance to existing clinical methods. Predicting the subacute infarct lesion may help clinicians prepare for decompression treatment and aid in patient selection for neuroprotective clinical trials..},

   abstract = {Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular disease with a high morbidity and mortality rate, which poses a serious challenge to human health and life. Meanwhile, the management of ischemic stroke remains highly dependent on manual visual analysis of noncontrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, artifacts and noise of the equipment as well as the radiologist experience play a significant role on diagnostic accuracy. To overcome these defects, the number of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods for ischemic stroke is increasing substantially during the past decade. Particularly, deep learning models with massive data learning capabilities are recognized as powerful auxiliary tools for the acute intervention and guiding prognosis of ischemic stroke. To select appropriate interventions, facilitate clinical practice, and improve the clinical outcomes of patients, this review firstly surveys the current state-of-the-art deep learning technology. Then, we summarized the major applications in acute ischemic stroke imaging, particularly in exploring the potential function of stroke diagnosis and multimodal prognostication. Finally, we sketched out the current problems and prospects.},
