# Final Project Video Submissions


Hi Team,
I just thought it would be helpful to everyone to have the rubric questions listed here for reference when creating our final project videos.

* What did you learn?
* What challenges did you face?
* How did you overcome those challenges?
* If you had more time, what would you add?
* What strengths do you bring to a team environment?

## Project Showcase Video Guidelines
In addition, here is the guide for the Project Showcase video/presentation:

* Each team will have 5 minutes to present your project during the Project Showcase on November 15th.
* This is not a lot of time, so you should not try to describe every step of your project.
* Instead, think of it as an "elevator pitch".
    * Assume that the audience is not an expert in your industry. Provide the required context.
    * Who are your intended stakeholders and why should they care about your project?
    * Explain your dataset in a way that your audience can understand.
    * BRIEFLY describe the tools/technologies that you used.
    * What are the key outcomes and takeaways? What is the business impact of your findings? Highlight one or two key visualizations or metrics.
    * If you had more time, what would your team have explored next?

It would probably be a good idea to script out what we want to say ahead of time to make sure we can fit everything in the 5 minute time limit, and to rehearse a few times to make sure we can deliver it smoothly.
